An exploration of some basic tooling to look into Windows Sysmon logs looking for common attack signatures

Security Log Analysis Tool for Windows Sysmon Logs

Statement of Intent:
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Security Log Analysis Tool for Windows Sysmon Logs. The tool aims to provide a user-friendly interface for security analysts and system administrators to efficiently analyze Sysmon logs, identify security incidents, and enhance the overall security posture of their Windows-based systems.

Goals:

    Sysmon Log Retrieval: Develop a module to access and retrieve Sysmon logs from the Windows event log repository. The tool should be able to fetch relevant logs, including event time, source, EventID, and the log message.

    Keyword-Based Search: Implement a search functionality that allows users to input keywords or phrases. The tool should then scan the Sysmon logs for these keywords and present the matching log entries for further analysis.

    Time-Based Filtering: Enable time-based filtering options to allow users to narrow down their search within specific time ranges. This feature will aid in isolating security incidents based on the occurrence time.

    Incident Classification: Develop a classification system to automatically categorize log entries based on predefined patterns or rules. The tool should identify common security events, such as malware execution, privilege escalation, suspicious network connections, and more.

    Interactive Analysis: Design an interactive and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate through log entries efficiently. Users should be able to expand event details, view event correlations, and access related logs easily.

    Event Correlation: Implement event correlation capabilities to identify sequences or patterns of events that could indicate advanced persistent threats or security breaches.

    Alerting Mechanism: Integrate an alerting system that notifies users of critical security events in real-time. The tool should provide customizable alerting rules based on specific criteria.

    Reporting and Exporting: Enable generation of detailed reports summarizing security incidents, patterns, and trends. Users should also be able to export log data in various formats for further analysis or archival purposes.

    Scalability and Performance: Ensure the tool's scalability to handle large volumes of Sysmon logs efficiently without compromising performance. Optimize the data processing and retrieval mechanisms.

    Security and Authentication: Implement robust security measures, including user authentication and access controls, to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and use the tool.

The Security Log Analysis Tool aims to simplify the process of analyzing Windows Sysmon logs, empowering security teams to
